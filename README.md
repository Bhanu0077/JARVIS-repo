## What Your Robot Can Do (Functionality)

AI Brain on Phone
Listens to your voice 🎤
Understands basic commands 🧠
Responds with robotic speech 🔊
Remembers info like your name / project 📂
Face Simulation (on phone screen)
Eyes blink 👀
Mouth moves while speaking 👄
Gives the illusion of a robotic head
Movement via Arduino
Moves forward, left, right, stop (on your command) 🚗
Nods/tilts with servos (expressions) 🤖
Idle small motions (so it doesn’t look dead)

## What’s Missing (Physical Appearance)

Right now, your phone is the head (face + brain).
Arduino + motors/servos = body/muscles.
But physically, it’s just:
Phone mounted on a chassis/stand.
Wires, motors, wheels visible.
👉 That’s why it feels incomplete in “robotic appearance.”

## Options for Physical Appearance (Budget-Friendly)

You don’t need 3D printers or expensive shells. Here’s how you can make it look like a real robot:
Robot Head (Phone Face)
Mount your phone inside a cardboard / plastic box with a cutout for the screen.
This makes it look like the phone is the “face” of the robot.
Robot Body
Use a cheap 2-wheel robot car chassis kit (~₹500–800).
Attach the head (phone + box) on top.
Looks like a moving little robot.
Arms (Optional)
Add cardboard arms attached to servos (not functional, just for looks).
Decoration
Spray paint the box black/white/silver → futuristic.
Add LED strips for “energy glow.”

 ## Final Behavior (as Demo)

When you show it:
Robot sits still, blinking.
You say “Hello Jarvis” → it blinks, nods, greets you.
You say “Move forward” → it rolls forward.
You say “What’s my name?” → it recalls and speaks.
After 10 sec idle → it tilts head slightly like it’s “thinking.”
👉 That way, your lecturers see AI + movement + personality + physical robot presence.
